Intro to Mac
September 30, 2025 · 12:30 PM

Welcome — this guide will get you started with the basics of using a Mac. Please feel free to suggest edits or add tips.
## Essentials

If you’re switching from Windows, Linux, or Chromebook:
- Most Control-based shortcuts map to the Command key (Cmd). The Command symbol is ⌘.
- Copy: `⌘-C`
- Paste: `⌘-V`
- Cut: `⌘-X` (if a direct Cut isn't available in an app, you can Copy then use Move with `⌘-⌥-V`)

## Spotlight

Spotlight helps you quickly find files, open apps, and do quick calculations or conversions.
- Press `⌘-Space` to open Spotlight.
- Use `⌘-Shift-Space` for a focused file search (some apps or system versions may differ).

## App switcher

Use the app switcher to move between running applications:
- Press and hold `⌘`, then press `Tab` to open the app switcher and cycle through apps.
- Keep holding `⌘` and repeatedly press `Tab` (or use `⇧-Tab`) to move backward.

## Files & Finder

Finder is macOS's file manager.
- Toggle views with `⌘-1`, `⌘-2`, `⌘-3`.
- Drag frequently used folders or files to the Finder sidebar to add them to Favorites.
- Handy Finder shortcuts:
    - `⌘-Shift-A` — Applications
    - `⌘-Shift-D` — Desktop
    - `⌘-Shift-G` — Go to Folder (type a path)
    - `⌘-Shift-H` — Home folder

## Secondary / Right-click

Ways to right-click on a Mac:
- Use a multi-button mouse and right-click normally.
- Hold `Ctrl` and click with one button.
- Use a two-finger click on a trackpad (enable in System Settings > Trackpad).

## Terminal

The Terminal is the command-line interface on macOS (similar to Command Prompt on Windows).
- Open it from Applications > Utilities > Terminal, or search for “Terminal” in Spotlight.

It looks plain by default, but you can customize it. If you want better themes and plugins, consider installing Oh My Zsh.

Replace the example image in this repo with your own screenshot at `images/terminal.png` (or update the path below):
![Terminal screenshot](images/terminal.png)

To install Oh My Zsh, run this in your Terminal (this is the official install command):
```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

Popular alternatives to the default Terminal:
- iTerm2 — https://iterm2.com/
- Warp — https://www.warp.dev/
- Alacritty — https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty

## Screenshots and screen recording

macOS has built-in screenshot and recording tools:
- `⌘-Shift-5` — open the screenshot / screen recording toolbar (pick still or video).
- `⌘-Shift-4` — select an area or press Space to capture a window.
- `⌘-Shift-3` — capture the entire screen.

## Some recommended apps

- Raycast — https://www.raycast.com/
- KeyCastr — https://github.com/keycastr/keycastr
- CleanShot — https://cleanshot.com/
- Helium Browser — https://helium.computer/

## Submit a screenshot or recording

If you have a short screen recording or a screenshot showing a tip or app you like, add it to this repository (for example, under `media/` or `images/`) and mention it in this file. Suggested submissions:
- A short recording demoing a Mac app you recommend.
- A quick tip or workflow (e.g., Finder trick, Terminal alias).
