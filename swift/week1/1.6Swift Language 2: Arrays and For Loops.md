# Swift Language 2: Arrays and For Loops

# Arrays

## Arrays are ordered lists of data

- Imagine an announcement in school, asking for your class to report somewhere (maybe a dental appointment. Fun! 🦷)
    - The announcer won’t call you by name, one by one. That’d take forever!
    - They’ll ask for your class name, e.g. Secondary 2C, since that *one name refers to all of you*.
    - If they want just the first few members of the class, that works, too — you probably have an *index number* in your class list, so they can call for “Secondary 2C, index numbers 1 to 10”.
- That’s a single variable (or constant) that has all of your names in an ordered list. An **array**!

## Storing data without arrays

This is one way to store data. What could go wrong here?
(Don’t type this code out — it’s just an example!)

```swift
var student1 = "Alice"
var student2 = "Bob"
var student3 = "Charles"
var student4 = "Eunice"
// oh no! we forgot one
var student5 = "Deborah"
// wait, they're not in order, we need to swap s4 and s5
var tempstudent = student5
student5 = student4
student4 = tempstudent
print(student4)
print(student5)

// Alice got food poisoning and dropped out
// Now we need to move everyone again
student1 = "I give up"
```

## Storing data *with* arrays

How about with arrays? Using arrays, we simply do the following:
(Type *this* code — feel free to skip the comments.)

```swift
var students = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charles", "Deborah"] 
// Students are numbered from 0. So Alice is 0, Bob is 1, Charles 2, Deborah 3.

students.append("Eunice") // Add a student at the end.
print(students) // Print all the students to see what’s inside.

print(students[0]) // Who 's the first student?

students.remove(at: 0) // Remove a student! Everyone’s index updates automatically.
print(students)

students [0] = "Blob" // Oh we spelled Bob's name wrong
print(students)
```

## **Array, visualised**

- Store multiple items, in an ordered list, into a single variable.
- This array, for instance, is of `String`s:
`var array = ["🍎", "🍌", "🍒", "🦖", "🐘", "🐟 "]`
    - Arrays start counting from 0. This is the **index**.
    - Each item in the index is called an **element**.
    - Arrays in Swift **must be of the same type**.

## Working with arrays

These are commonly-used functions, and a property, that apply to an array variable. To use them, put the name of the array, followed by a dot, and the function/property name.

- `.append(newElement)`: Add an element to the end
- `.insert(newElement, at:)`: Add an element at a certain index. Adding at 0 would add it to the front.
- `.remove(at:)`: Remove an element at a certain index
- `.count`: How many items in the array. This is a property, not a function; there are no parantheses!

## Exercise 1

There are various ways to solve some of these!

- Create an array, `[1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`
- Delete the fifth element (not the element with index 5)
- Insert these elements at the end: `11`, `12`, `13`, `14`
- Insert these elements at the front: `-3`, `-2`, `-1`
- Insert `0` at the right place
- Print everything out to make sure you have the right ordered list from `-3` to `14`

# For Loops

## Looping through an array

- Now that we have arrays, we want to be able to work with the data within.
- To do that, you need to work with each individual element of the array.
    - You might want to print each out, change each of them, sum them up, or find the largest in an array of numbers.
    - You never want to give them up; let them down; run around and desert them.
- Computers handle these operations sequentially, element by element. To do this, we use a **for loop**.

## Looping through a range

- You can loop through a range of values. They can be *inclusive* of both numbers, *closed* `...`, or *half-open* `..<`
- In a loop, you get an iterator: `_` means we don’t do anything with it; calling it `index` means it’ll take on the value each time through the loop.

```swift
for _ in 0...10 {
    print("This actually runs 11 times!”)
}

for index in 0..<10 {
    print("I have eaten \(index) jars of Nutella. I need a doctor.")
}
```

You can also use a range to loop through an array — this is handy when you want to do something with its index!

```swift
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "pineapple"]

for fruit in fruits {
    print(fruit)
}

for i in 0..<fruits.count {
    print("Fruit number \(i+1) is \(fruits[i])")
    // Fruit number 1 is apple
}
```

## Exercise 2.1

- Create an array, `["Banana", "Potato", "Papaya"]`
- Loop through the array, and print out the following:

```
I like to eat Banana!
I like to eat Potato!
I like to eat Papaya!
```

- See if you can do it with `for-in`, and also with an index!

## Exercise 2.2

- Create an array, `[1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 100]`
- Loop through the list, and print out only the odd numbers.

```
1
3
5
```

- You’ll need an if statement before printing, e.g.: `if item % 2 != 0`
- See if you can do it with `for-in`, and also with an index!

## Exercise 2.3

- Create an array, `[1, 2, 300, 6, 7, 100]`
- Loop through the list, and print out the sum of all the numbers.

```
416
```

- You’ll need:
    - A variable to store the total `sum` so far
    - This variable should start at `0`
    - Keep adding the new number to this variable
- See if you can do it with `for-in`, and also with an index!

Additional demos about sorting
var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

numbers += [99, 11, 12, 13]
numbers = [-3, -299, -1, 0] + numbers

print(numbers)

let newNumbers = numbers.sorted(by:>) // .sorted()
print(newNumbers)

print("Numbers is...")
print(numbers)

numbers.sort()
print("Numbers is now...")
print(numbers)
